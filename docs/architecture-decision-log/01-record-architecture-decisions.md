# 1.  Record architecture decisions

Date: 2024-11-03

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Since this project is about a simple inventory management system, we need to keep track of all the important design choices we make.

## Decision

We will create a document called the Architecture Decision Log (ADL) to keep all our choices in one place. Each choice will be written down as an Architecture Decision Record (ADR).

Each ADR will be recorded using [Michael Nygard template](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), which contains following sections: Status, Context, Decision and Consequences.

## Consequences

We need to write down all our important decisions in the log. We should also include older decisions with the dates they were made. New decisions should be added regularly.
